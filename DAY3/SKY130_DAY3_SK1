## IO placer revision
There are 4 stratergies that supported by IO placer to change the IO ports placement. IO placer is one of te opensource EDA tool to place the IO's around the core area.

## SPICE deck creation for CMOS

## SPICE simulation lab for CMOS inverter
The steps to follow for SPICE simulation   
1. Go to ngspice.   
2. change the directory (where the related files kept).  
3. Source the circuit file. it says the now the circuit is present in the ngspice simulator.  
4. To execute the circuit, the command is run.  
5. Give command setplot --> it will show which plots are currently available in the simulator.   
6. Select the plot. Give command name as that plot name.    
7. Give display command to see which nodes are available.     
8. To plot the graph give command plot out vs in.   
9. We can see the plot for above inputs. In this the width of both PMOS &NMOS is same.

The width of Pmos is bigger than Nmos by 2.5 times here is the graph

## Lab steps to git clone vsdstdcelldesign

To clone the gitlink the command used here is,  
/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane$ git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign.git
