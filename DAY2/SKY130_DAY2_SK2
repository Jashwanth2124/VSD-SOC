#  SKY130_D2_SK2 - Library Binding and placement
##  Topics to be covered
**--> Netlist binding and initial place design**   
**--> Optimize placing using estimate wirelength and capacitance**  
**--> Final placement optimization**    
**--> Need for libraries and characterization**    
**--> Congestion aware placement using RePLAce**    


## Netlist binding and initial place design

## Optimize placing using estimate wirelength and capacitance
## Final placement optimization

In the placement stage we have to place the cells according to the input and output of the cells. we can see below,

Here we can see how we place cells and inserting buffers and how we connect the input to the output.

## Need for libraries and characterization

Logic Synthesis -->Floor Planning --> Placement --> Clock Tree Synthesis --> Routing

For every stage of physical design the common thing is across all stages is Gates or cells. we can see here types of cells or gates.

1.All cells information are available in the library.   
2.Shapes & Size of cells.    
3.Timing and delay information of the cells.    

 
Global placement main goal is reduce wirelength, In openlane we use HPWL (Half parameter wirelenth), reduction of HPWL is main goal in openlane.

placement ensures that standard cells are properly placed on standard cells rows.
