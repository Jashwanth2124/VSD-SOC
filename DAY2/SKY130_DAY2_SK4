**Propogation Delay**  
The time difference between when the transitional input reaches 50% of its final value and when the output reaches 50% of its final value.   
Dealy = output time threshold - input time threshold

**Transition Time**

Transition time is the time caluculated as 20% of VDD(as low) and 80% of VDD (as high)
